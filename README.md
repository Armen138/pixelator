==============

platform game based on my bbgchallenge7 entry(dino street freak)

## update 2018

This game is broken in many ways. The "A2D" rendering engine has been unmaintained for years now, and only recently superceded by the Salad game engine.
I will replace A2D by Salad, and use better looking graphics while I'm at it (Thanks opengameart.org!)
